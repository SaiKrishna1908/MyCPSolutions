1625C - Explanation

1. dp[i][j] represents the minimum time to drive between the two cities, if we consider first i signs and have already removed j signs.
2. To calculate the total time without any removals the recurrence is as follows

	* indexes start from zero.

	sum((d[i]-d[i-1]) * a[i-1]) + (l-d[n-1])*a[n]  where 1<=i<=n-1

3. dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + (d[i]-d[i-1]) * a[i-1]
